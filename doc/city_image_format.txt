Images in The City
---

Images may be stored in a raw format (no RLE or compression) at 2bpp
Several of the images are 160 x 72 (e.g. guild, healer, etc)

  160 x 72 = 11520 pixels
  2880 bytes (4 pixels/byte? = 2bpp = 4color)

Portal and Abduction Background are 160 x 192


---

Color table is stored in a separate file.
It appears that different palette is used for every row of the image.
The four colors in the image are each assigned a value from the color table.

  432 bytes / 72 rows = 6 bytes per row

Not quite sure how those 6 bytes are interpreted.
Each image color should use one byte, though that would only require 4 bytes.
It also seems that the values are not all distinct, which seems odd as the colors for the different image pixel values would be identical
