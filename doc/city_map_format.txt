Note: Some areas can have roofs!  These protect against rain
 - How are these encoded?  As zones, or as additional data for the cell beyond the wall data?

---

The maps for the original Atari 8-bit version of AR: The City are stored in in two files (CityMapWalls.xfd and CityMapLocations.xfd), each 4096 bytes in length.

=====================

The first file "CityMapWalls.xfd" contains 4096 bytes, each of which represents a square on a 64 x 64 grid.  X and Y coordinates for each square range from 0 to 63 and increase from left to right and top to bottom, respectively.  Each byte in the map encodes the walls to display for the corresponding element of the map grid as follows:

 L| D| R| U
--+--+--+--
76|54|32|10

  L = The type of wall to apply to the left edge of the cell
  D = The type of wall to apply to the bottom edge of the cell
  R = The type of wall to apply to the right edge of the cell
  U = The type of wall to apply to the top edge of the cell

The valid wall types are:

  00 (0) - No wall / open
  01 (1) - Wall
  10 (2) - Secret door
  11 (3) - Door

=====================

The second file "CityMapLocations.xfd" contains 4096 bytes, each representing a location ID assigned to the corresponding square on the 64 x 64 grid.  The coordinate system used for this file is identical to that of the "CityMapWalls.xfd" file.

The location descriptions and logic associated with the various codes appears to be embedded within the game engine itself.
The value appears to be a combination of an index in the lower nibble (A), and a set of flags in the high nibble (B).

   B  | A
  ----+----
  7654|3210

Flags for B
-----------
  0000 [0  0] - None
  ???1 - Scenario
    0001 [1  1] = Inn
    0011 [3  3] = Tavern
    0101 [4  4] = Bank
    0111 [7  7] = Shop
    1001 [9  9] = Smith
    1011 [B 11] = Expansions/Addons (e.g. Dungeon, Palace, etc)
    1101 [D 13] = Healer
    1111 [F 15] = Guild
  ??10 - Covered/enclosed area (perhaps these may affect encounter rate as well?)
    0010 [2  2] - Goldenrod roof, Dark gray (almost black) floor
    0110 [6  6] - Pink roof, Dark blue floor
    1010 [A 10] - Cyan roof, Navy/purple floor
    1110 [E 14] - Bright yellow roof, Black floor
  ??00 - Encounter rate/danger level?
    0100 [4  4] - lower encounter rate? nothing visible
    1000 [8  8] - high encounter rate? nothing visible
    1100 [C 12] - ? nothing visible

The various codes are as follows:
